## How to Play

1. Open the game in your browser.  
2. Use the **arrow keys** (↑, ↓, ←, →) to move the snake.  
3. Direct the snake to eat the food; every food eaten increases the snake's length and your score.  
4. Don’t hit the walls or your own tail — that’s game over.  
5. Try to achieve the highest possible score.
